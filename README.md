# TeleICU Remote Monitoring System

## Overview
The TeleICU Remote Monitoring System is designed to enhance the monitoring of ICU patients remotely using advanced deep learning techniques. This project focuses on developing models for real-time object detection and patient activity recognition to support healthcare professionals in TeleICU environments.

## Problem Statement
Current TeleICU systems face limitations in scalability and accuracy, requiring real-time monitoring of multiple ICU patients by remote healthcare professionals. The goal is to reduce the burden on medical staff while ensuring timely interventions and accurate patient monitoring.

## Features Offered
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes TensorFlow and PyTorch for precise identification of objects (e.g., nurses, doctors, patients) in ICU settings.
- **Activity Recognition:** Models patient activities to detect critical events and anomalies when patients are alone.
- **Performance Metrics:** Measures prediction time and accuracy of detection over live video footage.
- **Technical Documentation:** Provides detailed insights into algorithms, data preprocessing, and model implementation.
- **Innovative Approach:** Integrates cutting-edge deep learning methodologies to optimize TeleICU monitoring capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning models
- OpenCV for real-time video processing
- Python for scripting and implementation
- Matplotlib for visualizations
